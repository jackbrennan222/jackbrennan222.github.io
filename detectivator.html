            The app resembles the current “Akinator” game. The user must come up with a character, real or fictional, and the detective will try to figure out who the character is by asking yes/no/maybe questions. If the detective doesn’t guess the correct answer, the user will provide the character’s name and a description (the algorithm is crowd-sourced). However, unlike Akinator, the game is intended for people to learn Spanish vocabulary and how to formulate questions. We will do this by having the sentence displayed in English and Spanish, along with a button for hearing the Spanish pronunciation. The algorithm has many sample questions it can ask. It will ask up to 20 questions. If it does not know the answer after 20 questions it will prompt the user to reveal their character, thus expanding Detectivator’s knowledge.
