            <p>I am in the final year of a 4+1 integrated Master's Program at the Colorado School of Mines studying Computer Science. I completed my undergraduate education in three years, graduating Summa Cum Laude in May 2024. I am currently at Colorado School of Mines as a Master's student and an Adjunct Professor teaching CSCI306 Software Engineering.</p>
            <p>Most recently, I worked at Sysco as a Software Engineer Intern. I worked on warehouse device software for the Wearable and Mobile Technology team. Previously, I have developed a web application for the Colorado Education Association and a Windows application and financial database for Neuman and Esser. After graduation, I plan to work as an Associate Software Engineer specializing in Application/Web Development.</p>
